# Beautiful JSON
*"A simple and free JSON formatting tool"*

Beautiful JSON is a tool I built to make working with JSON more convenient. Paste your JSON data, and it will be instantly formatted or minified for you to view and copy. Everything happens directly on your device, ensuring your data stays completely private.

## My Motivation

- Quick Copy: Use the “Copy” button to grab your formatted JSON in a click.
